# Let's HTML

A brief intro to HTML and CSS.

### Can I have this on my machine?

Yes you can!

Clone this repo, or create a Fork and clone that one, then `cd` into the directory and type `open index.html`.
This should open the index.html file in your standard browser. You can also drag and drop it into your browser.

Feel free to change the styles and markup to get a feel for it!
